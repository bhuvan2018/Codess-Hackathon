                            <p class="mb-2">By Maria Rodriguez</p>
                            <p>Maria witnessed firsthand the transformative power of education in her community. Growing up in an underprivileged neighborhood, she saw many girls drop out of school due to various socio-economic factors. Determined to make a change, Maria founded a non-profit organization that provides scholarships, mentoring, and resources to girls in her community. Over the past decade, her initiative has helped hundreds of girls complete their education and pursue their dreams. Maria's work has not only changed individual lives but has also contributed to breaking the cycle of poverty in her community.</p>
